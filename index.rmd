# Welcome

Data visualization is a critical skill for anyone interested in using data to think and persuade. Its essence is converting raw data into a visual form that can be more easily apprehended than the full dataset. As a result, almost every data visualization is a simplification and approximation of a raw dataset, and thus involves a perspective -- the goals and biases of the person producing the visualization.

This course focusses on three aspects: what makes a good data visualization, designing and improving a visualization, and the technical computer skills needed to create visualizations.

##  What is Data Visualization?

Data visualization is the practice of turning data into graphics, which can be more easily interpreted than the raw data while remaining faithful to the original data and not misleading the intended audience. 

Data visualization approaches vary. For some purposes, highly customized graphic design and visual style are paramount. That's not our focus. We emphasize standardized graphical presentations -- which span a wide variety of visualizations -- that minimize the use of graphical elements not directly linked to the data.


## Accessibility

Data visualization is, as the name implies, the act of producing a product to be seen. This is a useful goal because our brains are very good at processing some kinds of visual information. Training to read visualizations can greatly increase the ability to extract information from a visualization, so it is important to know your audience -- students, the general public, people with well developed quantiative skills, or domain experts for the data you are presenting. All of these factors are central to knowing if a visualization is suitable and effective. Our target audience is university students.

Not everyone has the same visual abilities. Some people have vision that differs from the most common experience in some way -- perceiving [colours differently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness), reduced [acuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity), and other differences all the way to complete blindness. We should always keep these differences in mind when producing visualizations. To take the hardest challenge head on, what is the value in producing a visualization for someone who cannot see it? Data visualization is a process that uses the creator's visual and technical skills to present features of a dataset. Any data visualization should be [accompanied by a written description of the message to be conveyed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Alternative_text_for_images). Ideally the visual and written aspects will complement each other. A visualization does not "say" anything by itself; a written interpretation is an essential part of the process.
