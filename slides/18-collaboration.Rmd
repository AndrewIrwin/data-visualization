### Scenario

* Two people have cloned the repository to their computer and are both editing the same file

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/collaboration-02-rstudio-cloud-student.png")
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/collaboration-02-airwin.png")
```
]

### One person pushes a change to GitHub

* What happens when the second person tries to push a change?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../static/collaboration-03-conflict.png")
```

## Task

* Task 11: 
  * Add your name to the collaboration list, as part of a team, or by yourself. 
  * People not in teams will be assigned teams randomly. 
  * Resolve any conflicts that arise -- for example, two people using the same line of the table.
