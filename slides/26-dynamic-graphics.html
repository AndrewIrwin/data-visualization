# Plan

* Advantages and disadvantages of dynamic graphics?

* When should you use dynamic graphics?

* Examples

* Application in this course

---
class: middle
### When and Why should you use dynamic graphics?

* Interactivity

* Show changes over time (in the data) over time (as perceived by the viewer)

* Easy to make too complicated

* Requires interaction and may not immediately make the point you want to make

* Distracting

### Animations

Easy to create with `gganimate`. Make a regular ggplot, then use a variable to show how it changes over time.


```r
penguins %&gt;% ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm,
                        color = species)) + geom_point() + my_theme
```

### Summary

* Dynamic and interactive graphics can be fun to create

* Making good use of these features requires practice

* Use sparingly! Think of your audience and goals

* Best example: animation of gapminder data over years
