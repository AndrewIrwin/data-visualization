# Plan

* Finding data

* Reading data

* Checking data

* Subsetting data (filtering observations, selecting variables)

* Importance of metadata (source, units, how/why/when)

---
class: middle
# Where to get data?

* R packages

* Websites: gapminder, Our World in Data, Tidy Tuesday

* Large repositories: Statistics Canada, OECD

* Specialized repositories: Many COVID data repositories

* Small collections made by individuals

* Government "Open data"

* Many, many, many more sources: google

---
class: middle
# What to look for?

* Downloadable spreadsheets, comma separated variables files, text files

* R packages to download data

* GitHub repositories (and others: pangaea.de, osf.io, and many, many more)

* A license or terms and conditions of reuse and redistribution

### Example: gapminder

```{r message=FALSE}
electricity <- read_csv("../static/electricity_use_per_person.csv")
electricity %>% 
  filter(str_starts(country, "[AM]")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(`2010`, fct_reorder(country, `2010`))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Electricity use in 2010\n(annual kWh per capita)", y = "") + my_theme

# Summary

* Highlighted a few sources of data

* Easiest case is a `csv` format file

* Many R packages have data or have functions to retrieve data

* Always examine your data to be sure it was read and interpreted correctly

* Always look for metadata: units, how was data collected, who collected data, ...

## Task

* Bonus task: 

  * Find data online that you have not used before from a source in this lesson or anywhere else.
  * Download the data to your computer. 
  * Read the data into R. 
  * Make a simple plot of the data.
