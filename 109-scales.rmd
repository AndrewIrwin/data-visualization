# Using points, lines, colours, and shapes (#scales)

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

In the previous lesson you learned the computer skills to make a huge variety of plots. Here we will focus on how to use colors, shapes, lines, and text effectively on a visualization.

## Points and shapes

### Points vs lines

### Shapes

### Colours

### Shapes, colours, and fills

```{r}
penguins %>% ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y= bill_depth_mm, 
                        color = sex, shape = species)) + geom_point()
```



## Lines 

### Line types

### Line thickness

### Line colour

## Colour

### Discrete scales


### Continuous scales

## Using factor ordering to change plots
