# Tasks

Tasks for each lesson are described here. Each task is designed to demonstrate a particular skill or idea from the lesson or prepare for the next lesson.

Tasks will be evaluated on a 0-2 scale. The primary goal of each task is to perform the task, so the assessment will be 2 if the work is complete or mostly complete, 0 if the work is mostly incomplete, and 1 for roughly half complete tasks.

## Lesson 1

Find two data visualizations that you find informative, compelling, or in need of improvement.

Create a document that shows each visualization (the figure, or a snapshot of a dynamic visualization), provides the source (e.g., url and publication details if applicable). In a few sentences describe 
1. the data behind the visualization, 
2. main message conveyed by the visualization,
3. one or two features of the visualization that make it effective or suggestions for improvement. 
The goal of this project isn't to be right or wrong, but rather to start the process of looking at data visualizations through the perspective of creator, designer, and critic.

Submit your work as a single PDF on Brightspace.

## Lesson 2

1. Install R, Rstudio, and the packages identified in Healy, Chapter 1.
2. Login to [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) which can be used if you have trouble using R on your own computer.
3. Create github account. 
4. Answer the quiz on Brightspace which will ask if you were successful with each task or if you need help. Provide your github name.
5. Ask for help with any of these tasks if you need it. 


## Lesson 3

Make a simple ggplot in an Rmd. Knit the R markdown file. Nothing to submit.

## Lesson 4

Check out a github repository from online course. Add a plot to the Rmd document you find there. Commit your changes and push the Rmd file back to github.

## Lesson 5

Demonstrate use of group_by, filter, summarize.

R basics: c, str, class, typeof

Demonstrate facetted plots in a few ways.

Figure formatting. Axis labels. Legends. Colour scales. 

Work with dates using lubridate. Parsing, manipulating, plotting.

Learn to use a function from its help page. Learn about a dataset from its help page. Report in a Rmd document.

Learn somethign about dplyr from r4ds book. Demonstrate by solving an exercise.

Learn somethign from ggplot2 tidyverse website. Demonstrate. Give a menu of 2-3 tasks.

Demonstrate pivot longer and pivot wider.

Fix mistakes in code provided. (about 5 kinds of mistakes / error messages.)

Do a tidy tuesday. as Rmd

Do a tidy tuesday as slideshow. Make a Rmd slideshow to demonstrate creation of a figure and revision / elaboration. 5 slides.

Make 3 versions of same figure: Rmd version (webpage), pdf for printed page (b&w), slideshow (png, big fonts, simplify, extra colour)


Format a nice table using gt, kableExtra, etc
