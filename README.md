This is source material for course notes for STAT 2340 Data Visualization offered at Dalhousie University, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, by Andrew Irwin in the Winter term 2021 (January-April).

The formatted book can be read at [stat2430.github.io](https://stat2430.github.io/). (Once I set it up.) 

The notes were prepared using R Markdown and the **bookdown** package (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/home/about/ for how to compile this example.
