## Course calendar

**This is a tentative schedule which will be revised throughout the term.**

Each lesson has written notes, a recorded video, and slides. There is a fair amount of duplication among these materials. Some students will prefer the video, others will prefer the written notes and slides. I suggest you learn which you prefer, or if you need to watch the video and read the notes, by experimentation. The tasks are designed to be sure you know the most important parts of each lesson.

### Week 1: Jan 6-8

The three lessons introduce the content of the course, the tools we will use, and show you how to get your computer set up for the course.

Work on these elements in the following suggested order:

- Lesson 1: An Invitation to Data Visualization. [Notes](#ch_invitation), Video, [Slides](slides/lesson-01.html).
- Synchronous meeting Thursday 7 January, 8:35 Atlantic on Collaborate (Brightspace)
- Lesson 2: The tools we will use and why: R, Rstudio, ggplot, tidyverse, markdown, git, github. [Notes](#ch_tools), Video, [Slides](slides/lesson-02.html)
- Lesson 3: Installing R, Rstudio, packages, creating github account. [Notes](#setup), [Video](https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/159870/Home?itemIdentifier=D2L.LE.Content.ContentObject.ModuleCO-2083726).
- Task 1. [Instructions](#task_1). Submit on Brightspace.
- Task 2. [Instructions](#task_2). Submit on Brightspace.

Tasks 1 and 2 are due Monday 11 January at 9:00 am Atlantic time.

### Week 2: Jan 11-15

The three lessons this week discuss how we perceive visualizations, how to make your own simple scatterplot, and the how and why of using git in this course.

- Lesson 4: Look at data. [Notes](#look-data), Video, [Slides](slides/lesson-04.html)
- Task 3. [Instructions](#task_3). Submit on Brightspace.
- Synchronous meeting Tuesday 12 January, 8:35 Atlantic on Collaborate.
- Lesson 5: Making your first plot. [Notes](#first-plot), Video, [Slides](slides/lesson-05.html)
- Lesson 6: Version control concepts and working with git. [Notes](#vcs).
- Task 4. [Instructions](#task_4). Nothing to submit. This is preparation for Assignment 1.
- Synchronous meeting Thursday 14 January, 8:35 Atlantic on Collaborate. Live coding material: [R markdown](static/live-coding-01.rmd), [html](static/live-coding-01.html)
- Assignment 1. [Instructions](#assignment_1). Submit on github.

Tasks 3 and 4 are due Monday 18 January at 9:00 am Atlantic time. There is nothing to submit for Task 4, but you can't do Assignment 1 without doing it first, so please don't delay.

Assignment 1 is due Wednesday 20 January at 6:00 pm Atlantic time.
