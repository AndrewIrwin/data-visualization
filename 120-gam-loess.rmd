# GAM and LOESS smoothing {#smoothing}

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```


In this lesson I will show you how to create GAM and LOESS models and perform some basic tasks to interact with the R model objects that the functions create. In keeping with the goals of the course, we will primarily focus on using the models for visualization and not attempt a detailed statistical analysis of when and why you might use a particular model for inference.
