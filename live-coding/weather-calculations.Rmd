## Today in history

* compute quantiles of minimum and maximum temperature
* compute fraction of days with precipitation, and amounts of precipitation.
* compute proportion of runs of 3 days with 0, 1, 2, 3 days of preciptitation. are they independent?
* compute distribution of changes between today and tomorrow in min, max temperature; presumably symmetric or nearly so, so also mean absolute difference
* amount of snow on ground
* sunrise, sunset, max sun angle, moon phase

## Change over time (same day, differnet years)

## climatologies
