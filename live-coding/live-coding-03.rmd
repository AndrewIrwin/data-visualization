# Agenda

* Questions arising from lessons, tasks
* Task 4 update: some have not accepted invitation to join "Dalhousie-AndrewIrwin-Teaching" organization on GitHub. Look for email, or a link on the github web page, or write me for help.
* Use ggplot tools three different ways

## Replicate some plots from memory

## Combine the tools we've learned

## Create new plots
