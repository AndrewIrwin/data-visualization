# Detailed outline {#outline}

Synchronous sessions will be held on Tuesday and Thursday starting at 8:35 and ending by 9:55 (or earlier.) You can find the link to these sessions on [Brightspace](https://dal.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/159870/Home?itemIdentifier=D2L.LE.Content.ContentObject.ModuleCO-2083791). There is an [agenda](#sync) for each session.  Most sessions will be recorded and posted on Brightspace.

## Course calendar

**This is a tentative schedule which will be revised throughout the term.**

Each lesson has written notes, a recorded video (with slides), and links to textbook readings. There is some duplication across these materials. Some students will prefer to begin with the video, others will prefer to begin with the written notes and slides. I suggest you learn which you prefer by experimentation. The tasks are designed to be sure you know the most important parts of each lesson.

### Week 0: Before the course begins

An introduction to the course is provided by a welcome presentation called Course Mechanics: [video](https://dal.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9eabe994-44ad-42b8-9db3-aca00024fe2b) and [slides](slides/00-course-mechanics.html). After you watch this video, review the [course welcome](#welcome) and [syllabus](#syllabus). Then move on to Week 1.
