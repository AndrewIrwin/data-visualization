# Using colour well

## When to use colour in your graphics

To highlight information already distinguished in some other way

To distinguish a small number of categories (2-5)

As a semi-quantitative scale, particularly if only a few hues are used (e.g., red and blue) in varying degrees of brightness or saturation

Avoid using more than 5 colours 

It is hard to make quantitative comparisons between two colours
