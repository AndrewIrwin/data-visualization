# Asking questions and getting help

When you are learning a new subject or skill, you will have a lot of questions. Detailed questions about a particular skill. General questions about a topic. Big-picture questions about how to apply the material. Regardless of the question, asking questions well is a [superpower](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/13/asking-questions-is-a-superpower/). Why? A question is a way of crystallizing the uncertainty in your mind about a specific topic. The more specific your question, the easier it is to answer, and the more likely it is that the response will be helpful to you. Sometimes simply asking a question will lead you to the steps to answer the question for yourself. In fact, asking questions of yourself is an important part of learning and thinking.

Asking good questions can be challenging, especially in asynchronous learning. In a classroom, it's fairly easy: Can you give another example? Why did you do that calculation? What does the answer mean? Many questions you might ask in an in-person class don't translate well to other contexts: email, office hours, or online forums, because the immediate context of a class is missing. So it's up to you to add that context when you ask a question.

In the suggestions below, I am imagining your are preparing a question to help you learn a concept or skill in a course. You could be asking your instructor, a classmate, or even yourself. It's important to ask questions -- and [I want you to ask questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/04/04/ask-if-you-have-questions-isnt-enough/), so much that you should consider it part of your assigned work to formulate questions.

## Suggestions for asking questions

A few [suggestions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/):

-   Explain the context (is this about material from a video, the course notes, an assignment -- which one?, or just something that you are wondering about)

-   Say what you know (the topic is X, or the question asks for Y)

-   Say what you are trying to do (understand an argument, perform a calculation, fix an error in code)

-   Say what you think comes next or where you think you are stuck (I'm trying to figure out X, I don't know why the plot looks like Y)
